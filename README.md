vimrc
===

Simple vimrc configuration just to start using vim!

###Installation
To start using this *vimrc* you need:
  * Create a vim dir in your `$HOME`
  * Copy **colors** from your git to the dir just created
  * Copy **vimrc** in your `$HOME` and change its name in **.vimrc**

```bash
mkdir ~/.vim/
cp -r colors ~/.vim/
cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Notice that '~' means `$HOME`

Feel free to use and modify this configuration.
